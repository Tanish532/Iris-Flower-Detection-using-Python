# Iris-Flower-Detection-using-Python

The Iris flower detection is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the species of the Iris flower based on its four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this problem is the Iris dataset, which contains 150 observations of three different types of Iris flowers, each with 50 samples. The goal is to train a machine learning model using the features from this dataset to predict the species of a new Iris flower. This problem is often used to demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms.
